# osint-portfolio

This repository contains OSINT CTF write-up(s) and practice investigations completed as part of my learning process in open-source intelligence (OSINT).

The focus of these write-ups is on methodology, reasoning, and ethical use of open-source information rather than perfect outcomes.

All research shown here uses publicly available information and is intended for educational purposes only.
